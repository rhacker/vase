# Vase: Data-driven microservices

This system provides a data-driven and extensible way to describe and
run HTTP APIs that are backed by a durable database (Datomic).

### Vase should be considered beta technology

Vase has been used on real-world projects. Each new project teaches us
something more about what Vase can do. We're continuing to improve its
utility and usability. You may find some rough edges here and
there. When you do, raise an issue so we can make it better.

## Releases and Dependency Information

If you would like to use the latest developments in Vase, you will need to
clone this repository and install it locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/cognitect-labs/vase
cd vase
lein install
```

Stable versions are currently deployed to the Clojars repository.

[Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) dependency information:

```clj
 [com.cognitect/pedestal.vase "0.9.3"]
```

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) dependency information:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.cognitect</groupId>
  <artifactId>pedestal.vase</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Before you get started

Vase is built on top of [Pedestal](http://pedestal.io/)
and [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/). While you don't need to be a
Pedestal or Datomic expert to use Vase, a little introductory material
goes a long way. Newcomers to either will find these resources especially helpful.

### Pedestal

[Pedestal](http://pedestal.io/index#what-is-pedestal) is a collection
of libraries for building services and applications. The core
components of Pedestal
are [Interceptors](http://pedestal.io/reference/interceptors),
the [Context Map](http://pedestal.io/reference/context-map) and the
[Interceptor Chain Provider](http://pedestal.io/reference/chain-providers).

Interceptors implement functionality and the Context Map controls how
Pedestal behaves (i.e., when interceptor chain execution terminates,
going async, etc...). The Interceptor Chain Provider connects the
interceptor chain to a given platform, creates an initial context and
executes the interceptor chain against it. Each interceptor has access
to the context map during execution which means that interceptors can
_alter_ how Pedestal behaves. What about routes?

Routes are data structures that relate request paths to
interceptors. After expansion, They are consumed by a Router which is
implemented as an interceptor. When a matching route is found for a
given request, the interceptor(s) it relates to are enqueued on the
interceptor chain.

Pedestal ships with support for the Jetty, Tomcat and Immutant
platforms. Although these are all servlet-based platforms, interceptor
providers can be implemented for other platforms.

It should come as no surprise that
Pedestal [interceptors](http://pedestal.io/reference/interceptors) are
a crucial part of Vase so it is helpful to understand what they are
and how they work.

As you dive into more advanced Vase usage scenarios, you'll benefit
from a deeper understanding of Pedestal.  Here's where you should look
for more information:

- [Pedestal Docs](http://pedestal.io): The Pedestal docs site is a good launching point.
- [Pedestal Samples](http://pedestal.io/samples/index): A collection of samples demonstrating Pedestal's capabilities.
- [Pedestal Repository](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal): For those who like to dig into the source.

### Datomic

Datomic is a database
of [facts](http://docs.datomic.com/query.html#database-of-facts) and
Vase uses it as its backend store. You will immediately be confronted
by three Datomic concepts as you work with Vase: schema, query and
transaction. Of the three, Datomic queries offer the most variety and,
possibly, confusion. Datomic uses a declarative query language called
Datomic Datalog for
queries. [Learn Datalog Today](http://www.learndatalogtoday.org/) will
help you get up to speed with it.

The Datomic docs [site](http://docs.datomic.com/index.html) has
in-depth resources
covering
[schema](http://docs.datomic.com/schema.html),
[query](http://docs.datomic.com/query.html),
[transactions](http://docs.datomic.com/transactions.html) and
more. These are good resources to dive into as you move to more
advanced Vase usage scenarios.

## Getting Started

By default, Vase uses an in-memory Datomic database, using the
[publicly available Datomic-free](https://clojars.org/com.datomic/datomic-free)
version located in Clojars.

Everything you need to get up and running with Vase is packaged in Vase itself.
Vase is completely self-contained -- You don't need to setup Datomic or create a MyDatomic account.

### Using the template

This repository also includes a Leiningen [template](./template) for
getting started.  Look at the [template's
README](./template/README.md) for local/developer setup, otherwise

`lein new vase my-service`

### Adding Vase to a Pedestal project

Vase turns API descriptions into Pedestal routes. The API descriptions
specify actions for routes, these are turned into interceptors in the
Pedestal routes. This is done by `vase/routes`.

`vase/routes` takes an API base URL and an API specification. The routes it
returns can be used directly by Pedestal like this:

```clj
(require '[io.pedestal.http.route.definition.table :as table])
(require '[com.cognitect.vase]))

(defn make-master-routes
  [spec]
  (table/table-routes
   {}
   (vase/routes "/api" spec)))
```

The routes that `vase/routes` returns can also be combined with
hand-written Pedestal routes by concatenating the input to
`table/table-routes`:

```clj
(require '[io.pedestal.http.route.definition.table :as table])
(require '[com.cognitect.vase]))

(defn make-master-routes
  [spec]
  (table/table-routes
   {}
   (concat
     [["/hello" :get [hello]]]
     (vase/routes "/api" spec))))
```
